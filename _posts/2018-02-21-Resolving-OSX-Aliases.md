Mac OSX aliases are not symbolic links. Trying to read one may crash your code.

In an app I'm developing, I want users to be able to easily create a "library" of symbolic links to
other places on their machine, and this is most easily achieved for many of them by Cmd-Option-Dragging and dropping the files.
This creates an "alias", which is a special file that Apple dreamed up.  UNIX users are accustomed to symbolic links, and codes
written in UNIX will not follow or "resolve" Mac aliases. Instead, they will cause an exception to be thrown.

There used to be some libraries to handle this, but they relied on Apple's old Carbon framework which is no longer supported.
There is a [mac_alias](https://mac-alias.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package but the documentation is lacking. So, I found an
[old post on MacWorld](https://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20021024064107356) where one solution is given, and I ported that
for what I need.

Happy to share with you, so that you won't have to worry about this.  As an added bonus, you can tell it to convert aliases to symbolic
links, so that "next time" you won't have to deal with this.  Enjoy.

# Description:
# Mac OSX aliases are not symbolic links. Trying to read one will probably crash your code.
# Here a few routines to help. Run these to change the filename before trying to read a file.
# Intended to be called from within other python code
#
# Python port modified from https://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20021024064107356
#
# Requirements: osascript (AppleScript), platform, subprocess, shlex
#
# TODO: - could make it work in parallel when mutliple filenames are given
#
# NOTE: By default, this only returns the names of the original source files,
#       but if you set convert=True, it will also convert aliases to symbolic links.

The above code is part of the `utils/` directory in my [Panotti](https://github.com/drscotthawley/panotti/tree/master/utils) package.
The way it's called is in the context of trying to read an audio file, called in the file [panotti/datautils.py](https://github.com/drscotthawley/panotti/blob/master/panotti/datautils.py):

```python
def load_audio(audio_path, mono=None, sr=None, convertOSXaliases=True):  # wrapper for librosa.load
    try:
        signal, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, mono=mono, sr=sr)       # try to read the file 'normally'
    except NoBackendError as e:                                      
        if ('Darwin' == platform.system()):                           # if an exception is thrown, check: Am I on a Mac? If so try to resolve an alias
            source = resolve_osx_alias(audio_path, convert=convertOSXaliases, already_checked_os=True) # ...and convert to symlinks for next time
            try:
                signal, sr = librosa.load(source, mono=mono, sr=sr)   # Now try to read again
            except NoBackendError as e:                               # Ok, even that didn't work, giving up (for now).
                print("\n*** ERROR: Could not open audio file {}".format(audio_path),"\n",flush=True)
                raise e
        else:                                                         # Failure for some other reason.
            print("\n*** ERROR: Could not open audio file {}".format(audio_path),"\n",flush=True)
            raise e
    return signal, sr
```

Happy coding!

*NOTE: Currently this code only follows _one_ alias.  If there's an alias pointing to an alias to a file, it won't resolve to that file.
Full generality would involve adding an iterative or recursive way of traversing multiple aliases which...I may do later. ;-)*
